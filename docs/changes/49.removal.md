**Breaking change:** The manual `NexusLIMS_db_creation_script.sql` file and legacy `migrate_db.py` dev scripts have been removed. Database creation and schema management now use fully automated ORM-based workflows via SQLModel and Alembic. New databases are created with `nexuslims db init` (which uses `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()` and stamps the database at the current schema version). Existing databases continue using `nexuslims db upgrade` for schema migrations. This consolidates database lifecycle management in a single source of truth, eliminating the risk of drift between SQL scripts and ORM models. The test suite's `DatabaseFactory` fixture was updated accordingly and no longer requires a SQL schema file path parameter.
