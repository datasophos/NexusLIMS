Fixed instrument filestore path handling to correctly resolve paths that start with a leading slash. Previously, `pathlib` would treat leading slashes as absolute paths and discard the `NX_INSTRUMENT_DATA_PATH` base directory entirely. A new `join_instrument_filestore_path()` helper function now strips leading slashes before joining paths.
