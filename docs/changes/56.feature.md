Added `nexuslims-config dump` and `nexuslims-config load` commands for exporting and importing the full NexusLIMS configuration as a JSON file, making it straightforward to migrate configurations between deployments. Running `nexuslims-process-records -v` (or `-vv`) now also prints the effective configuration (with secrets redacted) to the log at startup.
