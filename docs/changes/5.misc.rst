Fixed documentation version switcher to use full semantic version numbers (e.g., ``2.1.0``) instead of major.minor versions (e.g., ``2.1``), and properly highlight the current version being viewed. The switcher now shows only the most recent patch version for each minor release and marks the highest version as stable.
