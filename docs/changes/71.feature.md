All CLI commands are now accessible through a single unified `nexuslims` entrypoint with subcommands (e.g., `nexuslims build-records`, `nexuslims config edit`, `nexuslims db`). The previous standalone commands (`nexuslims-process-records`, `nexuslims-config`, `nexuslims-migrate`, `nexuslims-manage-instruments`) have been removed. Tab completion is available for NexusLIMS commands. Run `nexuslims completion` to set it up.
