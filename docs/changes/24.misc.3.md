Added Alembic for database schema version control and migrations. Existing installations should run `uv run alembic stamp head` to mark the database as migrated. New schema changes can be tracked with `uv run alembic revision --autogenerate` and applied with `uv run alembic upgrade head`. Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.alembic]`.
