NexusLIMS can now be installed as a standard Python package via `pip install nexusLIMS` or `uv pip install nexusLIMS`, eliminating the need for source checkouts. All CLI commands (including `nexuslims-config edit`) work immediately after installation without requiring a pre-existing `.env` file, enabling a smooth first-run configuration experience. Package data files (schemas, migrations) are automatically included, and all entry points are properly wired.
