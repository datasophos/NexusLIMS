Fixed a validation error when extracting metadata from Gatan `.dm3` Diffraction files.  `magnification` and `stage_position` are now only written as core fields for dataset types whose schema declares them (Image / SpectrumImage); for other types the values are routed to extensions or dropped when empty.
