Implement extensible multi-destination export framework for NexusLIMS records. Records can now be exported to multiple repository systems (CDCS, LabArchives, eLabFTW) using a plugin-based architecture with protocol typing, auto-discovery, and configurable export strategies. The new `nexusLIMS.exporters` package provides:

- **Plugin-based destinations**: Export destinations are auto-discovered from the `exporters/destinations/` directory
- **Configurable strategies**: Choose between `all` (all must succeed), `first_success` (stop after first), or `best_effort` (try all, default)
- **Per-destination tracking**: New `upload_log` database table tracks export attempts to each destination
- **Inter-destination dependencies**: Destinations can access results from higher-priority destinations (e.g., LabArchives can include CDCS links)
- **New record status**: `BUILT_NOT_EXPORTED` status for records that were built successfully but failed to export to all destinations

Configure export strategy via `NX_EXPORT_STRATEGY` environment variable (defaults to `best_effort`). Existing CDCS configuration (`NX_CDCS_URL`, `NX_CDCS_TOKEN`) continues to work unchanged.

**Breaking changes**: Database migration required (`uv run alembic upgrade head`). The `nexusLIMS.cdcs.upload_record_files()` function has been removed in favor of the new `nexusLIMS.exporters.export_records()` API.
