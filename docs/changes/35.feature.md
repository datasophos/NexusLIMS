Added plugin-based export framework supporting multiple repository destinations (currently only CDCS, but LabArchives and eLabFTW support planned in the future). Includes configurable export strategies (`all`, `first_success`, `best_effort` via `NX_EXPORT_STRATEGY`), per-destination upload tracking, and inter-destination dependencies. New `BUILT_NOT_EXPORTED` status for records that failed to export.

**Breaking changes**: 
- Database migration required (`uv run alembic upgrade head`). 
- `nexusLIMS.cdcs.upload_record_files()` removed; use `nexusLIMS.exporters.export_records()` instead.
