The extractor plugin system can now be used as a standalone library without a
fully configured NexusLIMS deployment. Calling `parse_metadata()` on a
microscopy file (e.g., from a Jupyter notebook) no longer requires a `.env`
file, database, or NEMO/CDCS configuration. When configuration is unavailable,
metadata is extracted and returned normally; JSON sidecar writing and preview
generation are skipped with a log warning. The low-level registry API
(`ExtractionContext` + `get_registry()`) also works config-free.
