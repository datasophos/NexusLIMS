Added an example Jupyter notebook to the documentation demonstrating standalone
extractor usage across all supported file formats (DM3/DM4, TIFF, SPC, MSA),
including multi-signal files and the `registry.all_extractors` API for
inspecting registered extractors. The notebook can be downloaded directly from
the documentation page to run locally.
