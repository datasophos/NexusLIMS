The `nexuslims-process-records` command now supports `--from` and `--to` options to filter sessions by date range. By default, only sessions from the last week are processed (matching the previous behavior of the deprecated `__main__` entry point). Use `--from=none` to process all sessions regardless of date, or specify custom ISO-format dates like `--from=2025-01-01 --to=2025-01-31` to process a specific time range.
