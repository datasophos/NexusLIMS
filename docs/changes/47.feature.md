The `nexuslims-process-records` command now supports `--from` and `--to` options to filter sessions by date range. Use these options to process sessions from specific time periods, for example `--from 2025-01-01 --to 2025-01-31` to process all sessions in January 2025. Both date bounds are inclusive (the `--to` date includes all sessions ending by 23:59:59 on that day). Without these options, all pending sessions are processed regardless of date.
