Updated [local deployment documentation](https://datasophos.github.io/NexusLIMS/stable/frontend_guide/local-test-deployment.html) to fix a few errors and be more complete. Also simplified local HTTPS configuration quite a bit in the [`3.18.0-nx1`](https://github.com/datasophos/NexusLIMS-CDCS/releases/tag/3.18.0-nx1) release of NexusLIMS-CDCS.
