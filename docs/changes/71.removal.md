**Breaking change:** The standalone `nexuslims-process-records` command has been removed. All NexusLIMS functionality is now available through the unified `nexuslims` command, which has been greatly expanded (e.g., `nexuslims build-records`, `nexuslims config edit`, `nexuslims db init`, `nexuslims instruments manage`). You will need to update any scripts or cron jobs that invoke the old command.
