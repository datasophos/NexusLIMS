Implemented comprehensive test infrastructure unification to prevent test pollution and improve reliability. Added centralized singleton management via `SingletonResetter` class, unified test data across unit and integration tests with single-source-of-truth instrument configurations, and enhanced cleanup fixtures to reset module-level state between tests. All test instrument PIDs now use the unified "TEST-TOOL" identifier. Tests now automatically marked by location (unit/integration) for easier filtering.
