Add support for harvesting experiment metadata from NEMO usage event questions. The NEMO harvester now prioritizes data from usage events (what users actually did during their session) over reservation data (what they planned to do), using a three-tier fallback strategy that checks post-run questions, pre-run questions, and finally reservation questions to maximize record accuracy.
