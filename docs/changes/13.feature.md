Added Pydantic-based schema validation for the `nx_meta` data structure returned by extractor plugins. This provides early error detection with clear error messages when plugins return malformed/unexpected metadata. The base `NexusMetadata` schema validates required fields and common optional fields. This is not a user-facing feature, but should provide a base from which to extend more formalized metadata schema verification.
