Added Pydantic-based schema validation for the `nx_meta` data structure returned by extractor plugins. This provides early error detection with clear error messages when plugins return malformed/unexpected metadata. The base `NexusMetadata` schema validates required fields (`Creation Time` with timezone, `Data Type`, `DatasetType`) and common optional fields. TEM and SEM-specific schemas (`TEMImageMetadata` and `SEMImageMetadata`) extend the base schema with instrument-specific metadata fields for future extensibility. This is not a user-facing feature, but should provide a base from which to extend more formalized metadata schema verification.
