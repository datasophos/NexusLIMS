Added multi-signal file support to automatically expand files containing multiple signals or datasets (such as DM3/DM4 files with multiple images or spectra) into separate dataset entries in experimental records. Each signal receives its own metadata extraction, preview image, and XML dataset element with signal indices in the name (e.g., "filename.dm3 (1 of 4)").

> **Note:** Proper display and download of multi-signal records in the CDCS frontend requires an updated XSLT stylesheet, available in [NexusLIMS-CDCS commit 240a7f9](https://github.com/datasophos/NexusLIMS-CDCS/commit/240a7f9a87c799950b5bbf94ca30eedaef7a1adc).
