Added a new `nexuslims-manage-instruments` CLI tool with an interactive terminal UI for managing the instruments database. The tool provides list, add, edit, and delete operations with real-time validation, eliminating the need for direct SQLite access or ad-hoc scripts. This release also introduces a shared TUI infrastructure (`nexusLIMS.tui`) to support future interactive terminal applications, promoting code reuse and consistent user experience across all NexusLIMS TUI tools. The TUI supports theme switching (dark/light modes), provides field validation with helpful error messages, and includes confirmation prompts for destructive actions.
