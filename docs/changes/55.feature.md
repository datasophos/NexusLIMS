Added `nexuslims-config edit` subcommand that opens an interactive Textual TUI for editing the NexusLIMS `.env` configuration file. The form is organized into seven tabs (Core Paths, CDCS, File Processing, NEMO Harvesters, eLabFTW, Email, and SSL/Certs), pre-populates all fields from the existing `.env`, validates input before saving, and writes the updated file on Ctrl+S. NEMO harvester instances can be added, edited, and deleted via a DataTable with a modal form dialog. The eLabFTW and email sections include an enable/disable toggle that omits the section from the written `.env` when turned off.
