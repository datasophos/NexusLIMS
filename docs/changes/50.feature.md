Alembic database migrations are now shipped inside the installed package and can be applied using the new `nexuslims-migrate` CLI command. This eliminates the need to manually locate migration scripts or configure Alembic paths when NexusLIMS is installed via `pip` or `uv`. Users can now run commands like `nexuslims-migrate upgrade head` directly after installation, and all standard Alembic operations (current, history, downgrade, etc.) work transparently. The existing `uv run alembic` workflow continues to work for development from source checkouts.
