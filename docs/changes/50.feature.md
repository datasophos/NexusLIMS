Alembic database migrations are now shipped inside the installed package and managed through the new `nexuslims db` CLI command. This user-friendly tool provides simple commands for common database operations: `init` (initialize a new database), `upgrade` (apply migrations), `current` (show version), `check` (detect pending migrations), and `downgrade` (roll back changes). Advanced users can access the full Alembic CLI via `nexuslims db alembic [COMMAND]`. The tool automatically locates migrations whether NexusLIMS is installed via pip, uv, or run from source, eliminating manual path configuration. The existing `uv run alembic` workflow continues to work for development.
