Added auto-generated database schema diagrams to the developer documentation. The diagrams are automatically regenerated when documentation is built, ensuring they always reflect the current database schema. Includes both a modern PNG diagram (via Graphviz) and an interactive Mermaid ER diagram with field descriptions extracted from model docstrings.
