Add `NX_CLUSTERING_SENSITIVITY` configuration option to control the sensitivity of file clustering into Acquisition Activities. Higher values make clustering more sensitive to time gaps (resulting in more activities), lower values make it less sensitive (fewer activities). Setting to `0` disables clustering entirely and groups all files into a single activity.
